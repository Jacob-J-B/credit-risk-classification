## Overview of the Analysis

A supervised machine learning model was built to predict whether a loan would be healthy or at high risk of defaulting based on other parameters of the loan such as loan amount, interest rate, borrower income and the borrowerâ€™s dept to income ratio among other factors.  We used a classification algorithm that helps us decide how much each loan parameter contributes to the loan status, then based on those factors we can model whether a loan would be healthy or not.

## Results

* Logistic Regression Model:
    * The overall accuracy of the model was 99%.  
    * Healthy loans were predicted at 100% precision and High Risk loans were predicted at 85% precision
    * Recall rates, the number of true positives predicted, were 99% for Healthy Loans and 92% for high risk loans leading to a 99% weighted average

## Summary

In summary, this model is recommended based on the overall accuracy of the model.
